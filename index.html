  <p class="q"><b>MONKEY 007, THIS IS DISPATCH. DO YOU COPY?</b></p>

  <p class="a">Copy.</p>

  <p class="q">It seems, 007, that dispatch needs your services again. Your next mission: <b><i>retiring monkeys.</i></b></p>

  <p class="a">Retiring monkeys???</p>

  <p class="q">Affirmative. Dispatch has received intel that <a href="https://monkeyhelpers.org/"><i>Helping Hands: Monkey Helpers for the Disabled</i></a> was founded to raise and train capuchin monkeys to provide daily in-home assistance to people living with spinal cord injuries or other mobility impairments. But in 2021, in part due to advancing technology and a hostile legal environment, Helping Hands had to make the difficult decision to cease their training and placement services. And now, those monkeys need your help retiring.</p>

  <p class="a">What's my mission?</p>

  <p class="q">First, you'll have to make a donation on <a href="https://www.juicebox.money/@retirementarmy">Juicebox</a> to receive a high-security NFT. Next, you'll need to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/RetirementArmy">Twitter</a> and join our <a href="https://discord.gg/5yDtFrm3wZ">Discord server</a> where you can verify your NFT to unlock top secret intel. To learn about the monkeys, you'll have to rendevous at <a href="https://monkeyhelpers.org/">monkeyhelpers.com</a>.<p>

  <p class="a">Roger.</p>

  <p class="q">Don't mess this up 007. These monkeys need you...</p>
